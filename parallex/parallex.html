                        <b style="color:lightskyblue;">Desert exploration</b> is the deliberate and scientific exploration of deserts,
                        the arid regions of the earth. It is only incidentally concerned with the
                        culture and livelihood of native desert dwellers.
                        People have struggled to live in deserts and the surrounding semi-arid lands for millennia.
                        Nomads have moved their flocks and herds to wherever grazing is available,
                        and oases have provided opportunities for a more settled way of life.
                        Many, such as the Bushmen in the Kalahari,
                        the Aborigines in Australia and various Indigenous peoples of the Americas,
                        were originally hunter-gatherers. Many trade routes have been forged across deserts,
                        especially across the Sahara Desert,
                        and traditionally were used by caravans of camels carrying salt,
                        gold, ivory and other goods. Large numbers of slaves were also taken northwards across the Sahara.
                        Today, some mineral extraction also takes place in deserts,
                        and the uninterrupted sunlight gives potential for the capture of large quantities of solar energy.

                        Many people think of deserts as consisting of extensive areas of billowing sand dunes because that is the way they are
                        often depicted on TV and in films,but deserts do not always look like this.Across the world, around 20% of
                        desert is sand, varying from only 2% in North America to 30% in Australia and over 45% in Central Asia.Where sand
                        does occur, it is usually in large quantities in the form of sand sheets or extensive areas of dunes.The following
                        sections list deserts around the world, and their explorers. Expeditions are listed by their leaders; details of other
                        expedition members may be found via the links.

                    <b style="color:lightskyblue;"> Ocean exploration</b> is a part of oceanography describing the exploration of ocean surfaces.
                    Notable explorations were undertaken by the Greeks, the Romans,
                    the Polynesians, the Phoenicians, Phytheas, Herodotus, the Vikings,
                    the Portuguese and Muslims.
                    Scientific investigations began with early scientists such as James Cook,
                    Charles Darwin, and Edmund Halley. Ocean exploration itself coincided with the developments in shipbuilding,
                    diving, navigation, depth, measurement, exploration, and cartography.

                    <li><b style="color:lightskyblue;">Deep-sea exploration</b> is the investigation of physical, chemical, and biological conditions on the sea bed, for
                        scientific or commercial purposes. Deep-sea exploration is considered a relatively recent human activity compared to the
                        other areas of geophysical research, as the depths of the sea have been investigated only during comparatively recent
                        years. The ocean depths still remain a largely unexplored part of the planet, and form a relatively undiscovered domain.

                    <li>
                        In general, modern scientific deep-sea exploration can be said to have begun when French scientist Pierre Simon de
                        Laplace investigated the average depth of the Atlantic ocean by observing tidal motions registered on Brazilian and
                        African coasts. He calculated the depth to be 3,962 metres (12,999 ft), a value later proven quite accurate by
                        echo-sounding measurement techniques.Later on, due to increasing demand for the installment of submarine cables,
                        accurate measurements of the sea floor depth were required and the first investigations of the sea bottom were
                        undertaken. The first deep-sea life forms were discovered in 1864 when Norwegian researchers obtained a sample of a
                        stalked crinoid at a depth of 3,109 m (10,200 ft).

                        From 1872 to 1876, a landmark ocean study was carried out by British scientists aboard HMS Challenger, a sailing vessel
                        that was redesigned into a laboratory ship. The Challenger expedition covered 127,653 kilometres (68,927 nmi), and
                        shipboard scientists collected hundreds of samples and hydrographic measurements, discovering more than 4,700 new
                        species of marine life, including deep-sea organisms.They are also credited with providing the first real view of major
                        seafloor features such as the deep ocean basins.

                        <b style="color:lightskyblue;">Polar exploration</b> is the process of exploration of the polar regions of Earth – the Arctic region and Antarctica –
                        particularly with the goal of reaching the North Pole and South Pole, respectively. Historically, this was accomplished
                        by explorers making often arduous travels on foot or by sled in these regions, known as a polar expedition. More
                        recently, exploration has been accomplished with technology, particularly with satellite imagery.

                        From 600 BC to 300 BC, Greek philosophers theorized that the planet was a Spherical Earth with North and South polar
                        regions. By 150 AD, Ptolemy published Geographia, which notes a hypothetical Terra Australis Incognita. However, due to
                        harsh weather conditions, the poles themselves would not be reached for centuries after that. When they finally were
                        reached, the achievement was realized only a few years apart.

                    <li>
                        There are two claims, both disputed, about who was the first persons to reach the geographic North Pole. Frederick Cook,
                        accompanied by two Inuit men, Ahwelah and Etukishook claimed to have reached the Pole on April 21, 1908, although this
                        claim is generally doubted. On April 6, 1909, Robert Peary claimed to be the first person in recorded history to reach
                        the North Pole,accompanied by his employee Matthew Henson and four Inuit men Ootah, Seegloo, Egingway, and Ooqueah.

                    <li>
                        Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had planned to reach the North Pole by means of an extended drift in an icebound ship.
                        He obtained the use of Fridtjof Nansen's polar exploration ship Fram, and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations
                        for this expedition were disrupted when Cook and Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then
                        changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the geographic South Pole; uncertain of the extent to which the
                        public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June 1910, he led
                        even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when
                        Fram was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.

                    <li>
                        Amundsen's South Pole expedition, with Amundsen and four others, arrived at the pole on 14 December 1911,[4] five weeks
                        ahead of a British party led by Robert Falcon Scott as part of the Terra Nova expedition. Amundsen and his team returned
                        safely to their base, and later learned that Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey.
