					<strong>
						CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
					</strong>
					is used to apply styles to web pages.
					 Cascading Style Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS.
					  It is used to make web pages presentable.
					   The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
					    It allows you to apply styles on web pages.
						 More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page.

				<p> Styling is an essential property for any website.
					It increases the standards and overall look of the website
					that makes it easier for the user to interact with it.
					A website can be made without CSS,
					as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website.
					So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Basic Format:</strong>
					It is the basic structure of CSS style of an webpage.
				</p>
				<code>
					body {<br>
						background-color: lightgray;<br>
				    }<br>
					h1 {<br>
						color: green;<br>
						text-align: center;<br>
				   }<br>
					p {<br>
						font-family: sans-serif;<br>
						font-size: 16px;<br>
				   }
				</code>

				<header>There are three types of CSS which are given below:</header>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Inline:</strong> Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body 
					section attached with the element known as inline CSS.</li>
					<li><strong>Internal or Embedded:</strong> The CSS ruleset should be within the HTML file 
					in the head section i.e the CSS is embedded within the HTML file.</li>
					<li><strong>External:</strong>External CSS contains a separate CSS file that contains 
					only style property with the help of tag attributes.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Example:</strong>
					Let’s see a small example of HTML webpage with CSS styles.
					Here, we use styles to set the alignment and text color of a webpage.

					What does CSS mean?

					The word polymorphism means having many
					forms. In simple words, we can define
					polymorphism as the ability of a message
					to be displayed in more than one form.
					A real-life example of polymorphism, a
					person at the same time can have
					different characteristics.
					Like a man at the same time is a father,
					a husband, an employee. So the same
					person posses different behavior in
					different situations. This is called
					polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
					as one of the important features of Object
					Oriented Programming.

					How CSS is different from HTML?
				</header>

				<ul>
					<li> HTML is used to define a structure of a web page whereas CSS 
					is used to style the web pages by using different styling features.</li>
					<li>HTML consists of tags inside which text is enclosed and
				     CSS consists of selectors and declaration blocks.</li>
					<li>CSS can be internal or external depending upon the requirement.</li>
					<li>We cannot use HTML inside a CSS sheet but we can use CSS inside an HTML document.</li>
					<li>We cannot use HTML inside a CSS sheet but we can use CSS inside an HTML document.</li>

					Why is CSS used in HTML?
				</header>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Solves a big problem:</strong>Font, color, background style, element alignments, border,
						 and size tags had to be duplicated on each web page before CSS. This was a lengthy procedure.</li>
					<li><strong>Saves a lot of time:</strong>Because CSS style definitions are stored in external CSS files,
						 updating only one file can modify the entire website.</li>
					 <li><strong>Provide more attributes:</strong>CSS gives more specific features for defining 
							the look and feel of a website than simple HTML.</li>
					<li><strong>Pages load faster:</strong>CSS doesn’t require you to write HTML tag attributes all of the time. 
						A tag’s rule can be written once and applied to all instances of the tag. As a result, CSS uses less code,
						resulting in speedier download times.</li>
					<li><strong>Easier Website maintenance:</strong>CSS makes website maintenance much easier.
						 If we need to make a global change to the file,
						  we can simply alter the style, which will update all of the elements on the web page.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Multiple device compatibility:</strong>We can use CSS with older language versions because it is compatible with them.
						 CSS makes it possible to optimize material for several devices.</li>
					<li><strong>Base for web development:</strong>HTML and CSS is the basic skill that every web developer should know.
						 It is the basic skill that is required for building a website.</li>
					<li><strong>Makes your website look attractive:</strong> A website that’s dull and plain will not attract the user, 
						so adding some style would surely make your website presentable to the user.</li>
					<li><strong>Makes the design come live:</strong>A web developer is responsible for making the design given to him as a live product.
						 It is used for styling to develop the design of the website.</li>
					<li><strong>Increases user experience of the website:</strong>A website with a simple yet beautiful UI would help the users to go through the website easily.
						 It is used to make the user interface better.</li>
					<li><strong>More career opportunities:</strong>Since CSS is a basic requirement while learning Web Development, therefor there are abundant career opportunities for it.
						 As a freelancer, you can land up to many projects.</li>
